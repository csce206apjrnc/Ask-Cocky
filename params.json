{"name":"Ask Cocky Game","tagline":"USC Gamecock's Mascot will tell your future in this Magic-8 ball style game that uses voice recognition ","body":"### Welcome to the Ask Cocky GitHub Page.\r\nThis page contains all the information you need to get started playing our game, from the packages that must be installed, to the image files that make the game enjoyable.\r\n\r\n###Introduction\r\nFortune-telling   games   are   incredibly  popular   with teenagers  and  young-adults.  Oftentimes,  people  of this  age  group  will  take  online  quizzes  and  check their  horoscopes  in  order  to  try  predict  their  future. For this project,  a  fortune-telling  program was created that appeals  to  University of South Carolina students,  entitled “Ask  Cocky.\" In this program, the University of South Carolina's mascot, Cocky, answers a user-imputed yes-or-no question via voice recognition and text-to-speech software.\r\n\r\nThis program was created through the Tkinter Python package and imported voice recognition software, and it is played in a Graphic User Interface, or GUI. \"Ask Cocky\" is a very effective fortune-telling game because it’s both more attractive  than  a  simple  fortune-telling game run from the command line, and the fortunes are accompanied by colorful images and actual speech. It also answers spoken questions like a real person, instead of simply receiving input from a text line. Cocky speaks back to you as well, giving the game a more personal experience.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis program was made as a final project for CSCE206 at the University of South Carolina by Jessica Russell, Ashley Perkins, and Nicholas Carnabuci\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
