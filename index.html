<p>Fortune-telling   games   are   incredibly  popular   with teenagers  and  young-adults.  Oftentimes,  people  of this  age  group  will  take  online  quizzes  and  check their  horoscopes  in  order  to  try  predict  their  future. For this project,  a  fortune-telling  program was created that appeals  to  University of South Carolina students,  entitled “Ask  Cocky." In this program, the University of South Carolina's mascot, Cocky, answers a user-imputed yes-or-no question via voice recognition and text-to-speech software.</p>

<p>This program was created through the Tkinter Python package and imported voice recognition software, and it is played in a Graphic User Interface, or GUI. "Ask Cocky" is a very effective fortune-telling game because it’s both more attractive  than  a  simple  fortune-telling game run from the command line, and the fortunes are accompanied by colorful images and actual speech. It also answers spoken questions like a real person, instead of simply receiving input from a text line. Cocky speaks back to you as well, giving the game a more personal experience.</p>
